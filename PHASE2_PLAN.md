# JustaSwap Phase 2 - MVP & Frontend Plan

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on building a functional MVP with a React frontend that connects to our Phase 1 backend canisters.

## Main Objectives
1. Create a React-based frontend
2. Implement Internet Identity authentication
3. Build swap interface with client-side encryption
4. Connect frontend to backend canisters
5. Deploy complete MVP

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Frontend Environment Setup
- [x] Frontend already exists from initial project setup
- [ ] Update dfx.json to include frontend canister
- [ ] Install required dependencies

### Step 2: Core UI Components
- [ ] **App.jsx**: Main component with authentication state
- [ ] **Login.jsx**: Internet Identity login interface
- [ ] **SwapInterface.jsx**: Token swap form with encryption

### Step 3: Client Logic & Canister Integration
- [ ] Internet Identity authentication flow
- [ ] Client-side order encryption (simulated for MVP)
- [ ] Submit encrypted orders to Orderbook canister
- [ ] Status messages and error handling

### Step 4: End-to-End Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Local testing with full flow
- [ ] Verify batch processing after 5 seconds
- [ ] Deploy to IC mainnet (final step)

## Technical Requirements
- React + Vite
- @dfinity/agent, @dfinity/auth-client, @dfinity/principal
- crypto-js for encryption simulation
- Integration with existing Orderbook and Execution canisters

## Success Criteria
- User can login with Internet Identity
- User can submit swap orders through UI
- Orders are encrypted client-side
- Orders are processed in batches after 5 seconds
- Complete flow works end-to-end
