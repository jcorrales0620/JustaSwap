# JustaSwap Comprehensive Testing Plan (Phase 1 & Phase 2)

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing scenarios for JustaSwap covering both Phase 1 and Phase 2 to ensure robust functionality and readiness for production.

## Testing Categories

### 1. Core Functionality Tests âœ… (Already Completed)
- [x] Single order submission
- [x] Timer activation (5 seconds)
- [x] Inter-canister communication
- [x] Basic batch processing
- [x] Debug logging verification

### 2. Batch Processing Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Multiple Orders in Single Batch**
  ```bash
  # Submit 3 orders within 5 seconds
  dfx canister call Orderbook submitOrder '(record {owner = principal "user1-aa"; order_data = blob "\01\02\03"; transport_public_key = blob "\04\05\06";})'
  dfx canister call Orderbook submitOrder '(record {owner = principal "user2-aa"; order_data = blob "\07\08\09"; transport_public_key = blob "\0A\0B\0C";})'
  dfx canister call Orderbook submitOrder '(record {owner = principal "user3-aa"; order_data = blob "\0D\0E\0F"; transport_public_key = blob "\10\11\12";})'
  ```

- [ ] **Sequential Batch Processing**
  - Submit orders in batch 1, wait for processing
  - Submit orders in batch 2, verify separate processing

### 3. Edge Case Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Empty Batch Handling**
  - Let timer expire without submitting any orders
  
- [ ] **Large Order Data**
  ```bash
  # Test with maximum blob size
  dfx canister call Orderbook submitOrder '(record {owner = principal "test-aa"; order_data = blob "LARGE_DATA_HERE"; transport_public_key = blob "\04\05\06";})'
  ```

- [ ] **Rapid Order Submission**
  - Submit 10+ orders as fast as possible
  - Verify all are included in the same batch

### 4. State Management Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Canister Upgrade Persistence**
  ```bash
  # Submit orders
  # Upgrade canister
  dfx deploy --upgrade-unchanged Orderbook
  # Verify state is preserved
  ```

- [ ] **Batch Counter Increment**
  - Verify batch IDs increment correctly
  - Check counter persists across upgrades

### 5. Error Handling Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Invalid Order Format**
  - Submit malformed order data
  - Verify graceful error handling

- [ ] **Network Interruption Simulation**
  - Test behavior if Execution canister is stopped
  ```bash
  dfx canister stop Execution
  # Submit order and wait for timer
  dfx canister start Execution
  ```

### 6. Performance Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **High Volume Testing**
  - Submit 100 orders in a single batch
  - Measure processing time
  
- [ ] **Memory Usage**
  - Monitor canister memory with large batches
  ```bash
  dfx canister status Orderbook
  dfx canister status Execution
  ```

### 7. Security Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Principal Verification**
  - Ensure orders record correct submitter principal
  
- [ ] **Timer Manipulation**
  - Verify timer cannot be externally triggered
  
- [ ] **Cross-Canister Authorization**
  - Ensure only Orderbook can call Execution.processOrderBatch

### 8. Frontend UI Tests ðŸ”„ (To Be Done)
- [ ] **Login Flow**
  - Test Internet Identity login/logout
- [ ] **Swap Interface**
  - Test input validation and order submission
- [ ] **Batch Processing Feedback**
  - Verify UI updates after batch execution
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Simulate errors and verify user notifications

## Test Execution Script
Create `test-comprehensive.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== JustaSwap Comprehensive Testing ==="

# Test 1: Multiple orders in batch
echo "Test 1: Multiple orders in single batch..."
# ... implementation

# Test 2: Sequential batches
echo "Test 2: Sequential batch processing..."
# ... implementation

# Test 3: Frontend login and swap
echo "Test 3: Frontend login and swap interface..."
# ... implementation

# Continue for all test cases...
```

## Success Criteria
- All core functionality works as designed
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- No memory leaks or performance degradation
- State persists correctly across upgrades
- Security boundaries are maintained
- Frontend UI behaves as expected

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Basic functionality (already tested)
- **Medium Risk**: State persistence, concurrent operations, frontend integration
- **High Risk**: Security boundaries, high-volume scenarios, user experience

## Recommended Testing Priority
1. Multiple orders per batch (Critical)
2. State persistence (Critical)
3. Frontend login and swap interface (Critical)
4. Error handling (Important)
5. Performance under load (Nice to have)
6. Security boundaries (Important)

## Notes for Future Phases
Based on testing results, consider:
- Implementing rate limiting if performance degrades
- Adding more robust error handling
- Optimizing batch size limits
- Enhanced logging for production debugging
