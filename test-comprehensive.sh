## Test Summary
- Total Tests: $TOTAL
- Passed: $PASSED
- Failed: $FAILED
- Coverage: $COVERAGE%

## Test Categories Covered
1. **Security Tests**
   - Authorization checks
   - Unauthorized access prevention

2. **Normal Operations**
   - Single order submission
   - Multiple orders per batch
   - Batch processing

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty batch handling
   - Large data handling
   - Rapid submissions

4. **State Management**
   - Upgrade persistence
   - Batch counter increment

5. **Performance**
   - Cycle consumption
   - Load handling

## Recommendations
- All critical security checks are in place
- System handles edge cases gracefully
- Performance is within acceptable limits
