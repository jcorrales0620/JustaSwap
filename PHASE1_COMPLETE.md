# JustaSwap Phase 1 - Complete âœ…

## Summary
Phase 1 has been successfully completed! We have built and tested the core workflow from receiving encrypted orders to triggering batch execution using on-chain timers.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Environment Setup âœ…
- Installed IC SDK (dfx) version 0.27.0
- Installed Node.js version 22.16.0
- Installed and configured Mops package manager

### 2. Project Structure âœ…
- Created JustaSwap project with proper structure
- Configured dfx.json with two canisters (Orderbook and Execution)
- Set up Mops for package management

### 3. Orderbook Canister âœ…
- Implemented encrypted order storage
- Created batch management system
- Integrated 5-second on-chain timer
- Successfully calls Execution canister when timer fires

### 4. Execution Canister âœ…
- Receives batch orders from Orderbook
- Simulates vetKeys decryption process
- Logs all processing steps for verification

### 5. Testing âœ…
- Created test script (test-phase1.sh)
- Successfully deployed both canisters
- Verified timer functionality
- Confirmed inter-canister communication

## Canister IDs
- **Orderbook**: u6s2n-gx777-77774-qaaba-cai
- **Execution**: uxrrr-q7777-77774-qaaaq-cai

## Test Results
```
[0. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: Processing batch 0 with 1 orders.
[1. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: Simulating: Calling vetKeys system API to get decryption key for batch 0
[2. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: Simulating: Received key: SIMULATED_DECRYPTION_KEY_0
[3. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: Simulating: Decrypting order for principal aaaaa-aa
[4. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: Simulating: Calculating uniform clearing price and settling trades.
[5. 2025-07-13T18:42:52.678550056Z]: --- Batch 0 processed successfully. ---
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Build the React frontend
- Implement client-side encryption
- Create UI for order submission
- Integrate with the backend canisters

## Commands for Future Reference
```bash
# Start local network
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploy canisters
dfx deploy

# Submit test order
dfx canister call Orderbook submitOrder '(record {
  owner = principal "aaaaa-aa";
  order_data = blob "\01\02\03";
  transport_public_key = blob "\04\05\06";
})'

# Check logs
dfx canister logs Execution
```

Phase 1 is complete and ready for Phase 2 development! ðŸš€
